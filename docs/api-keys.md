# API keys and rate limits

Arcade can authenticate clients with API keys and enforce per-tier quotas.
Everything here is off by default; deployments are unaffected until `auth.enabled` / `ratelimit.enabled` are set.

## For API clients

Send your key as a bearer token, the same header ARC clients already use:

```
Authorization: Bearer bsvb_…
```

Requests without a key are served at the anonymous tier, limited per client
IP by a bucket local to the replica that handled the request (not shared
across replicas). An IPv6 client is bucketed by its `/64`, not its exact
address, so rotating addresses within that block (privacy extensions, CGNAT)
shares one bucket rather than getting fresh quota on every rotation. An
invalid, revoked or expired key gets `401` — it never
falls back to anonymous. A client IP that racks up 60 invalid-key attempts in
a minute gets `429` (`X-RateLimit-Reason: auth_failures`) before the key is
even looked at, unless the request carries a key already proven good in that
replica's cache. If the store can't be reached to verify an uncached (or
fully expired) key, the response is `503` with `Retry-After` — retry.

Quotas are measured in cost units per minute:

| Request | Cost |
|---|---|
| `POST /tx` | `submit_tx` (default 10) |
| `POST /txs` with n transactions | `read` up front, then `n × submit_tx` once the batch is parsed |
| `GET /tx/:txid`, `/policy`, `/v1/policy`, block processing-status | `read` (default 1) |

For a keyed caller the quota window is a fixed UTC minute, shared globally
across replicas; the anonymous tier and the fail-open fallback below are
per-replica token buckets that refill continuously instead. Because of the
fixed window, a keyed caller can burst up to roughly 2× its per-minute limit
across a minute boundary, and a small amount of leased-but-unspent quota can
go undelivered if a replica goes idle mid-window.

A request that reaches a quota decision (allowed or denied by quota) carries
`RateLimit-Policy` / `RateLimit` (draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers-11)
and `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`
(seconds until the window resets, not an epoch timestamp). `Remaining` is
approximate for keyed callers (replicas lease quota in chunks, so it reports
local state, not the live global total). On `429`, wait `Retry-After`
seconds; `X-RateLimit-Reason` is `quota`, `concurrency`, or `auth_failures`.
A `429` for the concurrency cap, and the `auth_failures` throttle, carry
**no** quota headers — only `Retry-After` and `X-RateLimit-Reason`.

`413` means the request can never succeed as sent, not "try again later":

- A `/txs` batch above the tier's `max_batch` (`maxBatch` in the body).
- A `/txs` body larger than the tier's byte cap, `max_batch × 32 MiB`
  (at most 256 MiB). A body over the 256 MiB ceiling gets a plain `413`
  even with rate limiting off.
- A single request whose cost is above the tier's entire per-minute
  quota. For a tier with a configured `max_batch`, this can only happen
  through misconfiguration (checked at startup). A tier with
  `max_batch: 0` (unlimited batch size) has no such check, so a large
  enough `/txs` batch can still hit this at request time.

A disconnect is logged server-side as status `499`, at `Debug` (not `Warn` —
it's ordinary client behavior, not something this service got wrong); the
client sees nothing (the connection is just gone). This covers a disconnect
both while a request is being charged and while a key is still being
identified (an uncached key, or a stale cache entry mid-refresh, with no
fresher answer to fall back to). The latter also counts as `canceled`, not
`error`, in the `bsv_broadcaster_apikey_cache_total` metric — it's the caller giving
up, not the key store failing.

A tier with `units_per_minute: 0` (unbounded) never carries
`RateLimit-Policy` / `RateLimit` / `X-RateLimit-*` — there's no quota to
report, so the headers are omitted rather than sent with meaningless values.
`max_in_flight` still applies, and its `429`s still carry `Retry-After` and
`X-RateLimit-Reason: concurrency`.

`SSE /events`, the chaintracks endpoints, and `/metrics` are **not** guarded
by API keys or rate limits at all, regardless of `auth.enabled` /
`ratelimit.enabled`: `/events` is served by a separate SSE listener (default
port 8082, scoped instead by its own callback token), chaintracks is its own
server, and `/metrics` is exempted on the main API so scrapers never need a
key. Don't rely on either `auth.enabled` or `ratelimit.enabled` to protect
them — keep them off the public ingress if that matters for your
deployment.

## For operators

```yaml
api:
  trusted_platform: cloudflare   # only when every request arrives via Cloudflare
  trusted_proxies: []            # CIDRs/IPs allowed to set X-Forwarded-For
auth:
  enabled: true
admin:
  enabled: true
  host: 127.0.0.1                # default; kubectl port-forward works with this.
                                 # set 0.0.0.0 only to let in-cluster tooling reach it directly
  port: 8090                     # never route through the public ingress
  token: ""                      # set via ARCADE_ADMIN_TOKEN
ratelimit:
  enabled: true
  expected_replicas: 3
  tiers:
    free:       { units_per_minute: 50,    max_in_flight: 5,   max_batch: 1 }
    standard:    { units_per_minute: 3000,  max_in_flight: 20,  max_batch: 100 }
    high:        { units_per_minute: 30000, max_in_flight: 100, max_batch: 1000 }
    unlimited: { units_per_minute: 0,     max_in_flight: 500, max_batch: 10000 }
```

**Trust model — read this before setting either option.** `c.ClientIP()`
(the source of the anonymous tier's bucket key and of every request log's
`client_ip`) trusts `X-Forwarded-For` only from a peer listed in
`api.trusted_proxies` (CIDRs or bare IPs; empty by default, so the header is
never trusted). `api.trusted_platform: cloudflare` is a separate, broader
trust decision: it honors `CF-Connecting-IP` **from any peer**, regardless of
`trusted_proxies`. That is only safe when Cloudflare is the sole ingress path
to the pod (e.g. a Cloudflare Tunnel) — otherwise any caller can set that
header itself and pick its own anonymous-tier bucket or spoof `client_ip` in
logs.

- `units_per_minute: 0` means no quota (an unbounded tier); `max_in_flight` still
  caps concurrency per key, split across `expected_replicas`.
- Tier names are lowercase and must match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]*$` (they're
  embedded in response headers and used as a metric label). `free` is
  required whenever `ratelimit.enabled` — it's the fallback for a key whose
  tier was removed from config, and admin key creation defaults new keys to
  it. `anonymous` is reserved; configure unkeyed callers under
  `ratelimit.anonymous` instead.
- Every tier must be payable: `costs.submit_tx` must fit inside
  `units_per_minute`, and `max_batch × costs.submit_tx + costs.read` must
  too (checked at config load; a tier that could never pay for its own
  batch cap fails startup, not the first request).
- Revocations and tier changes take effect within `key_cache_ttl_ms`
  (default 30s) while the key store is healthy. If the store is down, a
  key already resolved once keeps authenticating on its last known value
  for up to `key_cache_stale_max_ms` (default 10m); an uncached or fully
  expired key gets `503` instead.
- If the quota store is unavailable, keyed callers fail open to a
  per-replica bucket sized at the tier's own limit
  (`bsv_broadcaster_ratelimit_store_failopen_total`). A per-key breaker backs this:
  a reservation gets 2s to succeed, and after any real store error the
  breaker stays open for 10s (serving fail-open with no further store
  calls) before trying one half-open probe.
- Tiers must be declared in the config file; env vars can only override a
  field that's already present in a configured tier (e.g.
  `ARCADE_RATELIMIT_TIERS_PRO_UNITS_PER_MINUTE`) — they can add neither a
  new tier nor a new field on an existing one.
- With `admin.enabled`, `POST /api/v1/blocks/:blockHash/reprocess` moves to
  `POST /admin/v1/blocks/:blockHash/reprocess` on the admin listener, behind
  the admin token. With `admin.enabled: false` it stays public and
  unauthenticated, same as before this feature.
- Admin key management works independently of `auth.enabled` /
  `ratelimit.enabled` (it only needs a store that implements
  `APIKeyStore`), but a tier assigned to a key must still exist under
  `ratelimit.tiers` — populate that section even in an admin-only,
  quota-off deployment if you plan to issue keys on tiers other than `free`.

### Sharing one key set across deployments (`auth.store`)

By default keys (`api_keys`) and quota counters (`api_quota`) live in the main
store, so every arcade deployment has its own key set. When one service fronts
several deployments — e.g. one arcade per network (mainnet, testnet,
teratestnet, tstn), each with its own `store.mongodb` database and possibly on
different clusters, replicated across regions — point all of them at one
dedicated MongoDB database instead:

```yaml
auth:
  enabled: true                  # required when auth.store is set
  store:
    mongodb:
      uri: ""                    # set via ARCADE_AUTH_STORE_MONGODB_URI
      database: arcade_auth      # ARCADE_AUTH_STORE_MONGODB_DATABASE
      # Optional, same meaning as under store.mongodb; 0/unset = the values shown.
      # connect_timeout_ms: 10000
      # op_timeout_ms: 3000
      # query_timeout_ms: 8000
      # index_timeout_ms: 300000
      max_pool_size: 16          # unset = driver default 100. Auth traffic is light
                                 # and every api-server pod of every network shares
                                 # one cluster, so keep this small.
```

Every key path is `auth.store.mongodb.*`, and each has an env override
(`ARCADE_AUTH_STORE_MONGODB_URI`, `…_DATABASE`, `…_OP_TIMEOUT_MS`, …) that
works even when the config file has no `auth.store` block. With `uri` unset
(the default) nothing changes: keys and quota stay in the main store. Setting
`uri` requires `database` and `auth.enabled`; a `database` without a `uri` is
rejected so a typo'd env var can't silently fall back to the main store.

Only the api-server (`--mode api-server` or `all`) opens it: the auth
middleware, the rate limiter and the admin key endpoints all use it in place
of the main store. Its main store is untouched and still holds the
transactions. The URI is never logged; the startup log names only the
database.

**Database privileges.** The auth store touches only `<database>.api_keys` and
`<database>.api_quota`: it never reads or creates any other collection or
GridFS bucket and never runs a database-wide command (it pings the `admin`
database, which needs no privileges). It therefore runs under a role scoped to
just those two collections, e.g. an Atlas custom role with, on **each** of
`<database>.api_keys` and `<database>.api_quota`:

`find`, `insert`, `update`, `remove`, `createIndex`, `listIndexes`, `createCollection`

and no database-level privileges. On boot it creates the same indexes the main
store creates on those collections, under the same names (`api_key_hash`
unique, `api_key_created`, and the `api_quota_expires_ttl` TTL index), so the
auth database may also be another deployment's main database (e.g. mainnet's)
and both provision it without conflict. (`collMod` is only needed if a future
release changes the `api_quota` TTL; this one doesn't.)

When several deployments share one auth store:

- **A key works on every network that shares it.** That is the point, but
  issue keys knowing a testnet key is also a mainnet key. Manage keys through
  any one deployment's admin listener; they all see the same set (within
  `key_cache_ttl_ms`).
- **Keep `ratelimit.tiers` identical everywhere.** The key stores only its
  tier name; each deployment applies its own config's limits for that name,
  and a tier missing from a deployment's config falls back to `free` there.
- **Quota is one window per key across all of them.** A key's per-minute
  budget is shared by every api-server replica of every network and region,
  not granted per network.
- **Set `expected_replicas` to the total** number of api-server replicas
  across all deployments sharing the store: `max_in_flight` is divided by it.
- **Size `lease_fraction` for that total.** Each replica leases
  `lease_fraction × units_per_minute` at a time until shared usage passes
  `shrink_threshold`; with N replicas each holding a lease, the window can be
  overshot by up to N leases before they shrink to exact cost. Keep
  `lease_fraction ≤ ~shrink_threshold / N` (e.g. 12 replicas with the default
  `shrink_threshold: 0.8` → `lease_fraction` of about `0.06` or less).
- **The auth store is on the request path** for uncached keys and quota
  leases. If it is unreachable the usual degradation applies: cached keys keep
  working up to `key_cache_stale_max_ms`, uncached keys get `503`, and quota
  fails open to a per-replica bucket. Host it where every region reaches it
  within `op_timeout_ms`.

### Managing keys

```bash
kubectl port-forward deploy/api-server 8090:8090
export ARCADE_ADMIN_TOKEN=…
arcade apikey create --name acme --tier high      # prints the key ONCE
arcade apikey list
arcade apikey set-tier key_… unlimited
arcade apikey revoke key_…
```

The admin JSON API is strict: unknown fields are rejected, request bodies
are capped at 64 KiB, `name` is capped at 256 characters, and field names
are camelCase (`name`, `tier`, `expiresAt`). Tier names are lowercased on
write. The CLI reads the token from `--admin-token`, then
`BSV_BROADCASTER_ADMIN_TOKEN`, then `ARCADE_ADMIN_TOKEN` — prefer an env var
over the flag, since a flag value ends up in shell history. `--expires-in`
rejects a negative duration.

`BSV_BROADCASTER_ADMIN_TOKEN` is accepted by the **CLI** for forward
compatibility with the eventual `bsv-broadcaster` rebrand, but the
**server** still only reads `ARCADE_ADMIN_TOKEN` (via `admin.token`) until
that rebrand lands — setting only `BSV_BROADCASTER_ADMIN_TOKEN` and not
`ARCADE_ADMIN_TOKEN` configures the CLI to send a token the server was
never told about, and every admin request gets `401`. Set both, or just
`ARCADE_ADMIN_TOKEN`, today.
