// first sample — so every deploy or pod restart silently swallowed the first
// burst per label pair (a single block marking hundreds of txs MINED
// registered as ~0 on dashboards). Services call these helpers at
// construction time so every series they can emit is exported at 0 from the
// first scrape.
