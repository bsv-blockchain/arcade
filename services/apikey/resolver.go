// Resolver maps raw keys to stored records through per-replica LRUs. An
// entry is trusted for ttl (the worst-case delay before a revocation or
// tier change takes effect); past that it is stale.
//
// A stale entry is served non-blocking -- stale-while-revalidate -- ONLY
// once the key is known to be failing (a synchronous attempt to refresh it
// has already failed). Until then, a stale entry is refreshed the same way
// an uncached key would be: synchronously, so a revocation or tier change
// is bounded by ttl, not staleMax, for as long as the store keeps working.
// Once a key is marked failing, further refresh attempts run in the
// background, deduplicated to at most one in flight per hash and throttled
// to one attempt per staleRetryBackoff -- armed before each attempt starts
// and re-armed from when it finishes, not from when it was requested, so a
// lookup that hangs for the full lookupTimeout cannot leave every caller in
// between re-triggering their own attempt once a request-start-relative
// backoff would (wrongly) look expired. Any successful store round trip --
// found or not, background or synchronous -- clears the failing state.
//
// A caller whose ctx is canceled while a stale entry is being synchronously
// refreshed gets ErrUnavailable, not the cached value: the key is not yet
// known to be failing, so there's no basis for trusting a possibly-revoked
// answer over a direct one. Once a key IS known failing, a canceled ctx
// makes no difference -- serving stale there waits on nothing.
//
// Unknown keys are cached too, but in a separate, smaller LRU, so a flood of
// random strings cannot evict legitimate keys from the positive cache.
// Throttling a single client's flood of invalid-key attempts is Middleware's
// job (the per-IP auth-failure limiter), not the resolver's.
