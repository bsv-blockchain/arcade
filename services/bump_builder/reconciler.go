// reconcileBlock does the same for a big canonical block, against a TTL of
// 3× the tick interval (90 s by default). Without renewal another replica
// acquires the lease mid-pass and runs the same work concurrently —
// convergent, but it double-publishes MINED corrections and events (issue
// #339 review). So a heartbeat renews at TTL/3, the cadence store.Leaser
// documents, and cancels the pass when the lease is gone: when a renewal
// reports another holder, or when renewals keep failing past the last
// confirmed expiry (a single failed renewal inside a live TTL is retried,
// not fatal). That expiry is always the one the store granted, never a
// local now+TTL: a slow acquire or a skewed backend clock means the real
// lease lapses earlier than the local estimate, and a run of renewal errors
// would otherwise keep the pass alive past the point another replica could
// have taken the lease. Cancellation makes the store calls in flight return
// ctx errors, so the full-scan reports itself incomplete and stays armed and
// the tick's block stays queued — for whichever replica now leads. A nil
// leaser (single-replica mode) returns ctx unchanged.
//
// Two guards make that hold regardless of whether the renewal RPC ever
// returns. Each renewal runs under a deadline of min(heldUntil, now+TTL/3),
// so a renewal that hangs — a pool wait, a network or database stall; the
// Postgres leaser hands the context straight to pgx with no deadline of its
// own — comes back with DeadlineExceeded no later than the lease's expiry,
// and earlier when a retry inside the TTL is still possible. Independently
// of that, an expiry timer armed for heldUntil cancels the pass when it
// fires; every successful renewal moves it to the new expiry. The timer runs
// on its own goroutine, so it fires even while the heartbeat is blocked
