// Stale thresholds for the reaper rebroadcast scan.
//
// staleSeenOnNetworkAge: a row at SEEN_ON_NETWORK that's older than this
// is in a Teranode mempool somewhere but not advancing to MINED. Rebroadcast
// to refresh upstream state — a peer may have evicted the tx, a fee bump
// may be needed, or a callback may have been dropped. Long enough that we
// don't rebroadcast every tx that takes a few minutes to mine.
//
// staleReceivedAge: a row still at RECEIVED older than this never advanced to
// a network verdict — its broadcast produced no verdict (downstream timeout /
// 5xx / no per-slot body) and the in-memory requeue was lost (propagation
// restart, ctx cancellation), or an intake Kafka-publish failure stranded it
// and the submitter never retried. Rebroadcast to self-heal: the row carries
// RawTx and is a validated tx (intake validation failures land at REJECTED,
// never RECEIVED), so we accepted responsibility to propagate it. Long enough
// that the normal intake→ACCEPTED path (seconds) and the 2s in-memory requeue
// are never pre-empted by the reaper.
//
// staleAcceptedByNetworkAge: a row at ACCEPTED_BY_NETWORK older than this was
// accepted into a mempool but never advanced to SEEN — the merkle-service
// state-transfer that drives SEEN never arrived (the /watch registration was
// lost, or the tx propagated too narrowly for merkle-service's p2p to observe
// it). Rebroadcast to nudge it: re-registering gives merkle-service another
// chance to watch and detect the tx, and re-broadcasting pushes it to more
// peers so it can propagate wider. Safe to repeat every tick — the lattice
// forbids ACCEPTED_BY_NETWORK → ACCEPTED_BY_NETWORK
// (models.Status.DisallowedPreviousStatuses), so a still-accepted rebroadcast
// result is a store no-op: the stuck gauge drains only when the tx genuinely
// reaches SEEN/MINED/REJECTED, never via a spurious timestamp refresh.
//
// Parked PENDING_RETRY rows are NOT age-selected here: they carry a per-row
// next_retry_at and are drained by drainParkedRetries via store.GetReadyRetries.
// A flat eligibility age meant every parked tx waited the same 5 minutes no
// matter how many times it had already failed, and — because a failed
// rebroadcast never rewrote the row — that a row which kept failing was
// retried on every single tick while its frozen timestamp_at sank it out of
// the selection window entirely.
