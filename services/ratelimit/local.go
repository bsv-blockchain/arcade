// localLimiter is a per-replica token bucket per subject, refilling at
// perMinute/60 units a second with one minute of burst. It backs the
// anonymous tier (keyed by client IP, so spraying IPs costs the shared store
// nothing) and the fail-open path for keyed tiers. Nothing is shared across
// replicas, so a subject spread over N replicas can get up to N × perMinute.

// carry-over of whatever was left under the old limit. The same applies to
// the fail-open bucket: the first request after the shared store goes down
// finds a full bucket, not an empty one.
