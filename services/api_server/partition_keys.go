// familyPartitionKeys returns the Kafka partition key for each tx of a
// submitted batch. Txs connected through in-batch spends — tx i lists an
// input whose source txid is also in the batch — form a dependency family
// and share one key: the lexicographically smallest txid of the family.
// Isolated txs key by their own txid (keys[i] == txids[i]), matching the
// pre-#295 behavior and the single-submit path.
//
// Same key ⇒ same partition ⇒ per-partition Kafka order delivers every
// parent's admit to its dispatcher before its children's, which is what
// lets the dep-aware dispatcher keep honoring Teranode's "no parent and
// child in one /txs batch" contract without a cross-partition dep index.
// The root is the smallest member (not the first submitted) so the key is
// order-independent: a client retrying the same family with the batch
// shuffled maps to the same partition as the original messages.
//
// Only same-submission edges join a family. A parent submitted in an
// earlier HTTP request may land on a different partition than its child;
// that residual race is absorbed by the propagator's missing-parent
// safety net rather than by keying (see PropagationConfig.Partitions).
//
// inputs[i] holds the source txids of tx i's inputs (collectInputTXIDs).
// Empty strings and self-references are ignored, mirroring the dispatcher's
// admission guards. O((N+E)·α(N)) for N txs and E total inputs.

// over the publish set sees no in-batch parent for C and falls back to C's own
// txid — routing C to a partition its still-in-flight parent is not on, where
// that dispatcher's inFlight map has never heard of P and cannot hold C behind
// it. C draws TX_MISSING_PARENT and parks at PENDING_RETRY, when on a
// single-partition topic it was admitted in milliseconds. The partial-produce
// retry path has the same shape: the members that already landed dedup out on
// the retry, and the remainder recomputes onto a different partition than its
// own in-flight siblings.
